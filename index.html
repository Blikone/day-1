        <h3>A little about me....</h3>

    <div>
        <p>The following things are all true.</p>
        <li>
            <ul>I play the piano but haven't practiced my scales for about 6 years.</ul>
            <ul>I spent a year as a teacher, loved the instruction but hated the classroom management.</ul>
            <ul>I like cross-stitching but haven't worked on my current project since 2014.</ul>
            <ul>The favorite thing I've done in coding so far is JavaScript.</ul>
            <ul>I built a card game engine that allowed players to shuffle, draw, and discard cards, all with JavaScript.</ul>
            <ul>Unfortunately, my UI was really buggy.</ul>
            <ul>I'd like to revisit that project, maybe build an engine to display cards instead of just list them out.</ul>
            <ul>I was really proud of it at the time, having built everything myself except the shuffling algorithm.</ul>
            <ul>Programming is something I feel I can become really good at because my math brain really keys in to the flow of code.</ul>
