        <h1>Hello, my name is Jonathan.</h1>
        <h3>A little about me....</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The following things are all true.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I play the piano but haven't practiced my scales for about 6 years.</li>
            <li>I spent a year as a teacher, loved the instruction but hated the classroom management.</li>
            <li>I like cross-stitching but haven't worked on my current project since 2014.</li>
            <li>The favorite thing I've done in coding so far is JavaScript.</li>
            <li>I built a card game engine that allowed players to shuffle, draw, and discard cards, all with JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my UI was really buggy.</li>
            <li>I'd like to revisit that project, maybe build an engine to display cards instead of just list them out.</li>
            <li>I was really proud of it at the time, having built everything myself except the shuffling algorithm.</li>
            <li>Programming is something I feel I can become really good at because my math brain really keys in to the flow of code.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Question: These changes won't be on the master branch, so when do we decide when to push the changes in gh-pages to the master branch?</p>
        <p>Also, how do we make github display different versions that have been uploaded?</p>
